\chapter{Universal-algebraic aspects}


% ----------------------- contents from here ------------------------

Possibly fold this chapter into the next??

\section{A category of Type Theories}

\para If poss, use elegant Fiore et al ``second-order\ldots '' as framework for this!  Explain: this is \emph{much more literal to the syntax} than Cartmell, categories with attributes etc; but on the other hand, much more categorically tractable than more ad hoc presentations of the syntax.

Mention possible tie-in with formalisation in Agda??  (*)

\section{Internal algebras for operads}

\para Give fuller account of what I rush through in my previous paper: show  correspondence btn different notions of algebras for an operad!  (a) models of ess. alg. (Lawvere) theory (poss with extra structure: "P-maps"); (b) Batanin: monoidal globular categories (as used + nicely expounded in [GvdB]); (c) Leinster: (weak) T-structured categories.

Lovely rarely-cited WEBER paper gives source for most of this!  Possibly even \emph{everything} I need is there, in which case possibly move this section to appendix, and fold the first part of this chapter into the next chapter???
