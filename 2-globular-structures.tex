\section{The fundamental weak omega-groupoid of a type}


TODO: either here or in introduction, give historical background: the move from seeing it as a transitive relation, to a groupoid-up-to-prop-eq, to (``the parallels with the fundamental group of a space are inescapable'') a weak $\omega$-groupoid.

\subsection*{Hacking} \label{sec:hacking} To understand how the $\omega$-groupoid structure arises, it is instructive to make a start on its construction by hand.

(A few notes on derivations: read bottom-up; and obvious premises are omitted.  TODO: maybe put this earlier?)

The first term often derived for identity types is a witness for the transitivity of equality on $X$---which for us, of course, will give binary composition of 1-cells in $\Pi_\omega(X)$:
$$ x,y,z:X, u:\Id_X(x,y), v:\Id(y,z) \types c_X(v,u) : \Id(x,z)$$

How do we derive such a term?  We can just use $\Id$-elim:

TODO: give the derivation.

Of course, we could also have eliminated on $v$ first instead of $u$.  Alternatively, we didn't need to stop after one use of $\Id$-elim: we could have applied it to the second variable as well:

TODO: give this version too!

\begin{exercise}Derive terms witnessing one or more of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``symmetry of equality'', i.e.\ (weak) inverses of 1-cells:
$$x,y:X, u:\Id(x,y) \types ? : \Id(y,x)$$

\item \label{ex:assoc}associativity, for any one of the binary compositions terms above (or a mixture):
$$x,y,z,w:X, t:\Id(x,y), u:\Id(y,z), v:\Id(z,w)\ \types\ ? : \Id_{\Id_X}(\ c(c(v,u),t)\ ,\ c(v,c(u,t))\ )$$
(For bonus points, give a single derivation which works for any of the binary compositions above!)

\item horizontal composition of 2-cells:
$$ x,y,z:X, u,u':\Id(x,y), p:\Id(u,u'), v,v':\Id(y,z), q:\Id(v,v')\ \types\ ? : ? $$
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\subsection*{Outline of the proof}
Having tackled a few examples, we can now generalise the tactics involved, giving the main points of the full proof:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We constructed our composition operations as maps in the syntactic category, from contexts built out of the identity types of $X$ back into those identity types themselves.  This suggests that these are operations in some kind of \emph{endomorphism operad in the syntactic category}.

\item We used no special information about the type $X$; in other words, we effectively were deriving composition operations just over a \emph{generic type}, which can then be implemented on any other type.  (On this point, \cite{garner-van-den-berg}\ take a different approach; see \PARA\ref{sec:gvdb-comparison} below.)

\item We now want to see that this composition operad is \emph{contractible}!  What does this mean?  The exercises above, particularly the last two, are typical instances of the liftings that contractibility requires: given two parallel composition operations, we have to find another connecting them one dimension up; that is, given two terms $\sigma,\tau$ we have to derive a term of idenity type $\Id(\sigma,\tau)$ between them.

\item How do we do that?  Our context is built out of identity types, so we \emph{repeatedly apply $\Id$-elim} and hope that our target type simplifies until we can inhabit it.  As in the first derivation above, one might sometimes stop early; but as Ex.\ref{ex:assoc} shows, the most generally powerful approach is to eliminate away \emph{all} higher variables in the context, until only a single variable $x:X$ remains; so it is enough to show that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are propositionally equal once $x$ and its (higher) reflexivity terms $r(x), r(r(x)),\ldots$ have been plugged in for all the variables of $\sigma$ and $\tau$. 

\item In all the examples above, $\sigma$ and $\tau$ then computed down to higher reflexivity terms themselves, and so were definitionally equal.  In fact this turns out to be typical: \emph{the context $x:X$ is an initial object}, so $\sigma$ and $\tau$ must always simplify in this way, and we are done.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Globular contexts, and their endomorphism operads}

For any cwa $\C$, the class of dependent projections is closed under pullbacks, so by \PARA\ref{para:fibspans}, we can form the monoidal globular category $\FibSpans(\C)$; and maps of cwa's preserve dependent projections and pullbacks of them, so we have a functor $\FibSpans : \CwA \to \MonGlobCat$.

A globular object of $\FibSpans(\C)$ is then just a globular object $\Gamma_\bullet :  \G \to \C$ in $\C$, in which all the maps (equivalently, the basic $s_i,t_i$, for all $i$) are dependent projections:
$$\xymatrix{ \Gamma_0 & \ar@<0.5ex>[l]^s \ar@<-0.5ex>[l]^t \Gamma_1 & \ar@<0.5ex>[l]^s \ar@<-0.5ex>[l]^t \Gamma_2 & \ar@<0.5ex>[l]^s \ar@<-0.5ex>[l]^t \cdots}$$

Mention abuses of notation: $\End_\C(\A)$, $\End_\T(\A)$.

\subsection*{The theory of a generic type} TODO: Construct $\MLId[X]$; state universal property.

\begin{definition}Let $\MLId[X] \in \ThId$ be the extension of $\MLId$ by a single new type
$$\inferrule*[right=$X$-$\form$]{\ }{\diamond \types X\ \type}$$
and no further terms or axioms.
\end{definition}

$\MLId[X]$ is thus the free theory on a closed type (in $\ThId$): any closed type $A$ of a theory $\T$ uniquely determines a translation $F_A: \MLId[X] \to \T$ with $F_A(X) = A$.

By the adjunctions of \PARA\ref{para:??}, $\cl_\strat(\MLId[X])$ is thus the free object of $\CwAId_\strat$ with a distinguished closed type, and $\cl(\MLId[X])$ is free among CwA's $\C \in \CwAId$ with a distinguished context $\Gamma$ and type $A \in p(\Gamma)$.

In particular, for any such $\C$, $\diamond$, $A$, this gives a monoidal globular functor $\FibSpans(\cl(\MLId[X])) \to \FibSpans(\C)$, sending $\X$ to $\A$, and hence an operad map $\End_{\MLId[X]}(\X) \to \End_{\C}(\A)$.

So $\End_{\MLId[X]}(\A)$ acts on all other types $\A \in \C(\Gamma)$, naturally in $\C$ and $\Gamma$.  In view of this, we will give the operad a less unwieldy name:

\begin{definition}We will write $\PML$ for the globular operad $\End_{\MLId[X]}(\A)$ of \emph{generically definable composition laws}.
\end{definition}

\subsection*{} See what contractibility asks for, syntactically then diagramatically.

\subsection*{} Show $\X$ is initial, by giving $\cl(\MLId[X]) \to X/\cl(\MLId[X])$.

(Point out: normalisation could also be used.)

\subsection*{} Conclude: contractibility!  Action!  Functors!

\subsection*{} Add: groupoidality!


\section{The classifying weak $\omega$-category of a theory}

\subsection*{} Overview: what are we trying to build?

\subsection*{Representability: the type theoretic globes} More abstract view: set  up Kan situation!  Type-theoretic globes.

Make analogy with $\Top$.  How much detail to go into?  Separate subsection*?  Compare: \cite[\SEC 9]{batanin:natural-environment}, 

\begin{definition}
Let $\globe{n}$, the \emph{type-theoretic $n$-globe}, be the theory defined by the following axioms:
$$\begin{array}{l c}
n = 0: & \inferrule{\ }{\diamond \types X\ \type} \\
n > 0 : & \inferrule{\ }{\diamond \types X^s\ \type} \qquad \inferrule{\ }{\diamond \types X^t\ \type} \\
n = 1: & \inferrule{\ }{x: X_s \types p_1(x) : X_t} \\
n > 1:  & \inferrule{\ }{x:X_s \types p_1^s (x) : X_t} \qquad \inferrule{\ }{x:X_s \types p_1^t (x) : X_t} \\
\quad (1 < i < n) & \inferrule{\ }{x:X_s \types p_i^s(x) : \Id(p_{i-1}^s,p_{i-1}^t)} \qquad \inferrule{\ }{x:X_s \types p_i^t(x) : \Id(p_{i-1}^s,p_{i-1}^t)} \\
& \inferrule{\ }{x:X_s \types p_n(x) : \Id(p_{n-1}^s,p_{n-1}^t)} \\
\end{array}$$
\end{definition}

Then $\cl^-_\omega(\TT) := \ThId(\globes,\TT)$ is the underlying globular set of our desired classifying weak $\omega$-category of types of $\TT$.

Indeed, since $\ThId$ is co-complete, Kan extension of $\globes$ along the Yoneda embedding gives a left adjoint $\TT [-] \dashv \cl^-_\omega$.  Analogously to the geometric realisation $|X|$ of a globular (or simplicial) set, we call $\TT[X]$ the \emph{type-theoretic realisation} of $X$, a theory with axioms implementing 0-cells of $X$ as closed types, 1-cells as open terms mapping between these, and higher cells as terms of $\Id$-type.  (This follows from the usual colimit formula for Kan extensions\cite[??]{maclane:cwm} and the description of colimits in \ref{prop:colims-in-thid} above.)  In particular, $\TT[y(n)] = \globe{n}$.

$$\quad \xymatrix{ \GSets \ar@/_/[rrr]_{\TT [-]\, :=\, \Lan_\yon \globes \qquad \ \, } \ar@{}[rrr]|\top & & & \ThId \ar@/_/[lll]_{\cl^-_\omega\ :=\ \ThId(\globes,-)} \\ \G \ar@{^{ (}->}[u]^\yon \ar@/_/[urrr]_{\globes} }
$$

% spent fucking hours trying to get P-Alg into this diagram too,
% eventually gave up...

\para So, by \ref{para:homming-out-of-algebras}, to put a natural $P$-algebra structure on $\cl^-_\omega$ is equivalent to putting a co-$P$-algebra structure on $\globes$.  In particular, its coendomorphism operad $\End_{(\ThId)^\op}(\globes)$ acts naturally on $\cl^-\omega$; in other words, we can lift if to a functor into $\End_{(\ThId)^\op}(\globes)$:
$$\xymatrix{ & & \Alg{\left[\End_{(\ThId)^\op}\globes \right]} \ar[d]^U \\ \ThId \ar[urr]^{\cl^-\omega} \ar[rr]^{\ThId(\globes,-)} & & \GSets }$$

With this in mind, we investigate this operad.  As usual, an operad element of dimension $n$ consists of a natural transformation $(S_0,T_0,\ldots,S_{n-1},T_{n-1},R)$ between pylon diagrams, but this time going from the pylon representing the $n$-globe to one representing a pasting diagram as in \ref{fig:coendo-op} below.

Before proceeding to investigate contractibility in general, however, it is helpful to pause for a few observations on the low dimensions of this operad.

TODO: points to make: by arguments like before, or by normalisation, $X_0$ is again initial in the theory of any one-dimensional pasting diagram (i.e.\ path), and so the only elements of the operad in dimensions 0 and 1 are the ones you'd expect: the identity in dim 0, and a unique $k$-ary composition for each $k$ in dim 1.  But, more importantly, we also get that any map out of a globe (or any colimit of globes) into any $\TT[\hat \pi]$ (for 1-dimensional $\pi$) is determined by what it does to in dimensions 0 and 1.


\para[Contractibility]  Figure \ref{fig:coendo-op}\ depicts the lifting condition required for contractibility of $\End_{(\ThId)^\op}(\globes)$: this amounts to showing that whenever $(S_0,T_0,\ldots,S_{n-1},T_{n-1}$ are given making the lower dimensions commute, some $R$ can be found to complete the diagram.

We can restate this as an extension problem:
$$\xymatrix{ \TT[\delta (n)] \ar@{^{ (}->}[d] \ar[r]^{(\vec S, \vec T)} & \TT[\delta \widehat{\pi}] \ar@{^{ (}->}[r] & \TT[\widehat{\pi}] \\
\globe{n} = \TT[\yon(n)] \ar@{.>}[urr]^R}$$
By the observations above (TODO: work out where to put them!) this ``corner'' completes to a commutative square, so we in fact have a square-filling problem:
$$\xymatrix{ \TT[\delta (n)] \ar@{^{ (}->}[d] \ar[r]^{(\vec S, \vec T)} & \TT[\delta \widehat{\pi}] \ar@{^{ (}->}[r] & \TT[\widehat{\pi}] \ar[d] \\
\globe{n} = \TT[\yon(n)] \ar@{.>}[urr]^R \ar@{->>}[r] & \globe{1} \ar[r] & \TT[\widehat{s_1 \pi} = \widehat{t_1 \pi}]}$$

(TODO: rephrase this to avoid duplicating the diagram, while still keeping the train of thought clear!)
