\chapter{Introduction and background}

\section{Homotopy Type Theory: an introduction}

\para Similar to the introduction to my previous paper: a quick, accessible intro to the higher-categorical view of identity types.

\para Refer to appendices for full background on globular higher cats \& on DTT.  However: include a \emph{rough} introduction to the higher cats, \& a \emph{full} introduction to (\& discussion of) identity types.

\section{Survey of the field}

\para Goals!  What we're working towards in the short-term (eg sound and complete semantics, good analysis of categorical properties of $\Pi$, $\Sigma$-types, etc.

\para What's actually been done!  Some models, a few structures, syntactic analysis in dimension 2, applications as independence results...

Lots of references should go in this, of course!

\section{Outline of the present work}

\para Overall structure (composition of 2-cells along bounding 0-cell), reason therefor (aim of analysing type theories in the well-understood quasi-categorical setting).

\para Overview of the "universal-algebraic aspects" setup: technical, dry, but necessary!

\para Results of the "syntactic structures" section.

\para Results of the "homotopical constructions" section.

\section{Outlook: visions of a higher-categorical foundation}

\para Write up some of what's currently just in folklore, the $n$-lab, the categories list, boozy nights out with the gang, etc. :

Voevodsky's model(s) + axiom; the type theorists' OTT etc.; notions of ``the same''; ``category theory without equality'', etc.
