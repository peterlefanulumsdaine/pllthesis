\section{Bibliography}

Citation styles\ldots\ I don't like \textbf{[17]}---it makes them a complete black box, useless unless one flips constantly back and forth.  I quite like \textbf{[Batanin 2009]}, but it takes up a lot of space, so obliges one to cite less liberally; also it's perhaps a little eccentric.  Overall, \textbf{[Bat09]}\ probably a decent compromise---it's readable for someone who knows the literature a little, and to someone who doesn't, nothing short of the full title is much more useful anyway.

Author naming: full name, or surname only?  I prefer full names; again, since bulkier, this means using them a bit sparinglier than with surnames alone, but since I'm using mostly-readable citation style, I don't have to use names too often, so this seems OK.

\section{Sectioning}  numbering: follow Cisinski[?] and number just by paragraph within section?  Even within chapter??  Ask Michael \& Steve about this first...  but I think something like this is nice; it 

OK!  Here's what I think I want (5.vii):

chapters, section: as usual.

Subsections --- use just for their headings, \emph{not} numbered.  (display in toc?)

Theorems, definitions, pars: \emph{all} numbered consecutively within section.
Deliniated paras: numbered/named in bold, with no indent; ordinary paras: small indent.  As in: \\

\noindent \textbf{3.2\ Id-Types are awesome.}\ \ I think that $\Id$-types are awesome, and you should think so too!

The most fundamentally compelling reason for this is that\ldots \\
  
\noindent \textbf{3.3}\ \ However, if we look at some of the alternative eliminators for $\Id$-types, \ldots \\

Running page headers and references: if numbering paras (etc.) within sections,  reference that as [2.3.11] (and show it in running header for easy navigation?)
